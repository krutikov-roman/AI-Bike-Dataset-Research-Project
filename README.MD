# Bike Dataset Research

## Abstract

This project involved examining the Bike Sharing Data by Hadi Fanaee-T, which contains data about bike rentals from the Capital Bikeshare system from Washinton DC between 2011 and 2012, alongside data about times, seasons, and weather conditions. This dataset was examined using PyCaret (Python) to find the best regression model that would be able to predict the number of bike rentals given the features, as well as trying to find the most important features that affected the number of bike rentals. The hours.csv portion of the dataset was used, with certain columns from the file were either removed or transformed. It was found that the CatBoostRegressor model best predicted the number of bike rentals, with the top 4 most important features when predicting bike rentals being if is 5pm, cold it felt at the time of the bike rental, if it is 8 am, and if it is 6pm at the time of the bike rental.
